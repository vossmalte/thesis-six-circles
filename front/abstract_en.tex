The one page abstract of the thesis should summarize 
\begin{enumerate}[i]
\item the problem statement, 
\item the limitations of the state of the art, 
\item the goal of the thesis, 
\item the developed methods, and 
\item the achieved performance.
\end{enumerate}

An abstract in English is only needed if the thesis is written in English.
